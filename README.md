# Automatic vectorization and quantitative analysis of XIXth century maps of Paris (2022 Spring)

This repository includes the code and report for the semester project of DHLAB in 2022 Spring. 

This project analyzes the urbanization process with the help of the historical maps of Paris.

Maps have errors, especially the one published one hundred years ago. One strategy to understand what Paris looks like historically is to align the average maps we have each year. Therefore a sophisticated alignment algorithm is required.

In this project, two alignment algorithms are discussed. The first algorithm with affine transformation improves the alignment result for all the maps. The second algorithm with homography transformation has better performance and sometimes aligns maps perfectly with each other. However, this algorithm only works 50% of the time.
